## 📁 Project Structure

* `Ecommerce_Analysis.ipynb`: Main notebook containing data exploration, visualization, and the Linear Regression model
* `Ecommerce Customers`: Dataset containing customer session data and spending habits
* `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies

## 📈 Key Insights

* **Primary Driver:** Identified "Length of Membership" as the most significant factor in predicting yearly spend.
* **Platform Performance:** Compared "Time on App" vs. "Time on Website" to determine which platform yields higher engagement.
* **Model Accuracy:** Evaluated the model using MAE, MSE, and RMSE to ensure high predictive reliability.
* **Correlational Mapping:** Used Seaborn Pairplots and Jointplots to visualize the relationship between customer behavior and revenue.
* **Business Logic:** Calculated coefficients to provide actionable advice on whether the company should focus on mobile app or website development.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

* Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn)
* Jupyter Notebook
* Git & GitHub
